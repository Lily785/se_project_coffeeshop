# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

My plan for this project is for it to be as clean and crisp as I can make it, with as little errors as possible.
-if allowed I could improve it by possibly adding some personal touches.
-Personally, I think it would be cool for the header title to have an animation, like maybe slide in when first opening the webpage.
